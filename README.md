# Real-time-FFT-audio-spectrum-with-audio-recognition
This project provides a real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) audio spectrum analyzer combined with an audio recognition system. It captures audio input in real-time, visualizes the frequency spectrum, and recognizes specific audio patterns using machine learning models.
